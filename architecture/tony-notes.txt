- need to add UA schema retreival via test scripts first to validate via DB / Query Tools API
- update folder 'overview' at the top - looks sloppy and disjointed. fields are merged 'Files1 Objects26 Schema Errors0 Unkown Fields0 - Should be a summary Like 'Folder Summary/Totals' then each is a column like the per file output for TopN below it
- update naming of columns for folder overview - COM Schema vs DB Schema (once DB scheme is pulled and compared for fields in DB vs in COM)
- update view to handle / display eval pieces or string vs int dynamically regardless of field name - should be generic 'function' that can be passed each entry and parse the same regardless
- rules file management
    - confirm usage of /api/rule/Rules/{id} - do we use this currently to update the rule file, we SHOULD be!
    - verify how we could use the other APIs
        - /api/rule/Rules/readDiff
        - /api/rule/Rules/readRevisionHistory
        - /api/rule/Rules/executeRevert/{id}

- send docs to AI buddy for the below configs for editing
    - regex - need to use 
    - enrichment - custom / flatfile / redis?
