# Local Processor Schema References

This repo keeps a local, ignored copy of the processor schema JSON files for
reference and comparison when implementing override handling.

Source (on this host):
- /opt/assure1/var/docker/overlay2/d1feff3e780473f456628b92d836af178d12e9e80ffc09828e43bb099deb3709/merged/app/schemas/*.json

Local copy (ignored by git):
- architecture/processor-schemas-local/

Notes:
- These files are for reference only and are intentionally ignored by git.
- Use them to compare processor and override schema expectations when updating
  override handling logic.
