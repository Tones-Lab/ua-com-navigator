refactor(frontend): decompose FCOM builder sidebar and add context layer

Why:
- Reduce prop drilling and monolithic sidebar complexity during ongoing refactor.
- Improve maintainability and prepare for further App.tsx slimming.

What:
- Split builder UI into focused subcomponents (header, type selector, literal, eval, processor).
- Added shared builder types and a builder context/provider hookup.
- Introduced helper hooks/util extraction and simplified App-to-sidebar boundary.

Impact:
- No intended behavior change; structural frontend refactor only.
- Risk is low; mitigated by lint checks and preserved existing flows.
