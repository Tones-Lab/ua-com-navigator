refactor(fcom): complete phase 4 flow editor extraction

Why:
- Phase 4 required moving advanced flow and flow editor orchestration out of App-level inline code.
- The remaining monolithic flow canvas/parser/save paths in App.tsx increased risk and maintenance cost.

What:
- Extracted flow feature modules for canvas rendering, payload parsing, validation, editor state, and advanced-flow orchestration.
- Rewired App flow/advanced-flow paths to consume shared feature utilities and hooks, removing duplicated inline implementations.
- Tightened related FCOM builder typing/context surfaces and marked item 4 done in the refactor tracker.

Impact:
- Flow editor and advanced flow behavior remain intact while App.tsx is slimmer and easier to maintain.
- Risk is primarily flow orchestration wiring; mitigated by passing frontend lint/build validation gates.
